## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and it's an example app/project that you might work at Futbolsites, we wish you can show us your skills and your knowledge on these aspects.

The project is set up with a basic architecture so you can focus into the most important features.

## What we expect on this challenge:
- Features:
  - [X] Transcribe all components, than you find, from classes to functional in the Components folder.
  - [X] Implement a CR to handle **C**reate and **R**ead of the articles persisting them into **Local Storage**.
  - [X] We wish you to identify component issues that are not well designed, and improve their reusability

The CRUD have to follow these requirements:
- Must persist data with refresh (Local storage as mentioned above).
- Apply a State manager to handle the basic features (Mobx, Redux, Reflux, ContextAPI - Where you feel confortable, we wish to understand how you structure your logic)
- Validate and show input errors to prevent from submitting 

You can add any library into the project, but we wish to evaluate how you create your own components
